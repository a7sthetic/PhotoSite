        <p>So on this page I've decided to compile a short list of a few of my favorite modern Photographers. These are people I look up to and gain inspiration from.</p>

        <p>Jennifer Bin is an Toronto born <abbr title="User Experience / User Interface">UX/UI</abbr> designer and Photographer currently working in Shangai. Bin takes <em>urban</em> photographs, mostly from high up on rooftops.
        <br />Her photographs provide an incredible hard to get view of the world.<br />
            It's unique in the sense that many of us won't ever get the chance to experience the views that she's had to capture her amazing images.
        <br /> Luckily we can view them from the safety of our homes on our computers and phones.<br />
        <br /><br />
        <q><i>It’s easy to think that a photo with many likes on Instagram is a good photo, 
            but I always try to work on my own barometer of what makes a good photo, <strong>instead of letting the crowd decide for me.</strong></i></q>  </p>

        <p> Andre Josselin is German born traveling photographer. His photos give off a very <em>filmic</em> look. A unique style that shines on its own. 
        <br /> Almost all of his photos are shot with natrual light. He successfully captures the mood of the moment.

        <q><i>Nothing should look like it is staged, and overly retouched. And that’s how it works. It’s just <strong>me</strong>, the <strong>camera</strong>, the <strong>subject</strong>, 
            the <strong>situation</strong>, and the <strong>landscapes.</strong></i></q>

        <p>Josh Tep is in my opinion, the king of lowlight photography. Tep was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio.<br />
             His dark style is very distinctive as its not one that you see often when it comes to photography<br />
             When I look at his photos, I also think cinematography. Many of his photos look like they're a single frame from a futuristic movie.

            <q><i>Once you go through some shit...some real life shit, there is not a single thing that anyone could do or say to hurt you.<br />
                That’s the only positive that comes from struggling. You’ve been through it all. <strong>The gravity of it trounces all future conflicts.</strong></i></q>
