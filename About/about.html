                    <p><i>
                            Hey! My name is Kofi Boateng. I was born and raised in New York, but a majority of my family is from Ghana, the gold coast. 
                            Since I was little, I always admired the beauty of our world  and since I got my first phone, I couldn't stop taking photos. 
                            Thankfully, my family saw this and helped support me with getting camera equipment and I wouldn't be where I sam today without them. 
                            Now, I've been professionally shooting for over 3 years now and it's been an amazing time. I've gained the oppurtunity to travel, work with fun people,
                            and best of all capture beautiful memories.
                            My passion is to capture the world in my vision and share it for everyone to see.
